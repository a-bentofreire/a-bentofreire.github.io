My first professional project was in the field of mathematical optimization of residual water network drilling in 1987. In the 90s I developed software for several companies in a myriad of computer languages. It was followed for 14 years working on the field of computer graphics and desktop interfaces. In this decade, I worked for several years developing hybrid mobile applications and later resume my work back to data science and OOP programming.</div></div><div class="topic"><h2>Fields of Knowledge</h2><div class="topicline">OOP, Math related, Scripting and more</div><div class="desc">Over this 34 years of developing software, teaching about it, and data analysis, I worked in many fields ranging from database manipulation, website creation, server software, reverse engineer, mobile apps, but I have over a decade of experience on the fields describe at the top.
